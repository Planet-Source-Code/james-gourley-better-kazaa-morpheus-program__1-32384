VERY IMPORTANT... kinda

ok there are 2 zip files here.
	1.FastTrack.zip
		This contains the main code for searching and scanning 		for users.

	2.FastTrackDownloader.zip
		This contains the separate downloading function which is 		built separate so your download doesn't freeze if the 			program freezes.
		Contains file called "DownloadFile.KMD"
		  -This file is made by compiling the source code located 		   in the "FastTrackDownloader.zip" file. After compiling        		   it, simply rename it to "DownloadFile.KMD". Or you can 		   simply keep the one i have provided (Its bug free i 			   promise)
		  -Uses Downloader.ocx (submitted by sean gallardy, you 		   can search for his name and find the source code for 		   the downloader on PlanetSourceCode.com)

Extract both of these zip files to the same directory. 

Any questions/comments/tips/bugs, email me at M_iN_M_@hotmail.com or add me to msn or w/e... doesn't matter to me.
